I'm Iris Yang, a senior at Tufts University studying computer science. I'm currently exploring technologies from frontend, backend, to ML/data science/AI, robotics, and the cloud, and I find myself fascinated each day by what can be built by combining any of these fields. I aim to leverage my toolbelt of skills to contribute to a project with a tangible impact. Join me as I document my journey in the projects I make and display on here! 

Outside of CS-ing, I love kung fu, running, exploring new cafes and restaurants with friends, and music ðŸŽ¶. 

* I'm currently working on my personal website!
* I currently do research at Tufts' [MuLIP](https://mulip.cs.tufts.edu/) lab, studying how agents can be taught to play games using a combination of Deep-Q algorithms and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.
* Previously, I was a software development intern at S&P Global, building a RAG pipeline for a chatbot and making good use of AWS' services.
* To ask about my work, please reach out to me at iris.yang@tufts.edu. I'm happy to chat :)
