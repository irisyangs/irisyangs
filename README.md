I'm Iris Yang, a senior at Tufts University studying computer science. I'm currently exploring technologies from frontend, backend, to ML/data science/AI, robotics, and the cloud, and I find myself fascinated each day by what can be built and made tangible by combining any of these fields. I hope to document my journey in the projects I make and display on here! 

Outside of CS-ing, I love kung fu, running, exploring new cafes and restaurants with friends, and music.
